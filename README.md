# Dynamic-Adjustment-of-the-Pruning-Threshold-in-Deep-Compression


A PyTorch implementation of the paper "Dynamic-Adjustment-of-the-Pruning-Threshold-in-Deep-Compression".  
This code is built on [Deep-Compression-Pytorch](https://github.com/mightydeveloper/Deep-Compression-PyTorch.git), so if you need requirements for this project, check here.

### Dataset
I use CIFAR-10 dataset as a training set and test on MNIST dataset.

### Usage
```
python VC_pruning.py
```

### Note
DC_pruning and VC_pruning mean 'DenseNet with CIFAR-10', 'VGG16 with CIFAR-10'
