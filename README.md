# Dynamic-Adjustment-of-the-Pruning-Threshold-in-Deep-Compression


A PyTorch implementation of the paper "Dynamic-Adjustment-of-the-Pruning-Threshold-in-Deep-Compression".

This code is bulit on [Deep-Compression-Pytorch](https://github.com/mightydeveloper/Deep-Compression-PyTorch.git).

### Dataset
I use CIFAR-10 dataset as a training set and test on MNIST dataset.

### Training
```
python VC_pruning.py
``` 

### Note
  DC_pruning and VC_pruning mean 'DenseNet with CIFAR-10', 'VGG16 with CIFAR-10'
